- CRUD queries - In MongoDB, **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries are used to interact with the data stored in the database**. Here are some examples of each type of query:

  - Create: **To create a new document in a MongoDB collection, use the insertOne() method**:  
     db.users.insertOne({
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    email: "johndoe@example.com"
    })

  - Read: **To read data from a MongoDB collection, use the find() method**:
    db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1 })

  - Update: **To update a document in a MongoDB collection, use the updateOne() or updateMany() method**:
    db.users.updateOne(
    { name: "John Doe" },
    { $set: { email: "johndoe@example.org" } }
    )

  - Delete: **To delete a document from a MongoDB collection, use the deleteOne() or deleteMany() method**:
    db.users.deleteOne({ name: "John Doe" })

- Why MongoDB is better than other SQL data base

  - MongoDB is a **document-oriented NoSQL database**, which means that **it stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents** rather than in rigid tables with **fixed columns and rows** like in SQL databases. Here are some reasons why MongoDB may be a better choice than traditional SQL databases:

  - Flexible data model: **MongoDB is schema-less**, meaning that data can be stored in the database without having to define a schema in advance. This makes **it easier to handle unstructured data**and allows for a more flexible data model.

  - Developer-friendly: MongoDB's **JSON-based document model** is easy to work with and **supports rich data structures, including nested documents and arrays.** This makes it a popular choice for modern web and mobile applications.

  - Scalability: MongoDB is highly scalable, both vertically and horizontally. It allows you to add more resources to a single server or distribute data across multiple servers, making it easier to handle large amounts of data and high traffic.

  - Flexibility: With MongoDB, you can easily change the structure of your data without having to update the entire database schema. This allows for greater agility in development and makes it easier to handle evolving data needs.

  - Performance: **MongoDB is designed to be fast and efficient. Its query language and indexing capabilities are optimized for performance,** making it possible to handle large volumes of data quickly and with minimal hardware resources.

  - Replication and High Availability: **MongoDB allows for easy replication and failover,** ensuring that your data is always available even in the event of a hardware failure or network outage.

  - Support for Unstructured Data: **MongoDB is well-suited for handling unstructured and semi-structured data such as documents, audio files, and images, which may be difficult to store in a traditional SQL database.**

  Of course, whether MongoDB is better than other SQL databases depends on your specific use case and requirements. SQL databases may be a better fit for certain applications, such as those with strict data consistency requirements or complex transactional processing.

- aggregation basic
  Aggregation in MongoDB is the process of transforming and processing data from one or more collections in the database to return a result set based on a set of rules or criteria. It allows you to perform advanced operations like grouping, filtering, and computing aggregate values on collections of documents.

  The Aggregation Framework in MongoDB **consists of a set of stages**, which are applied sequentially to the data in the collections. **Each stage can transform the data in a specific way**, and **the result of one stage is passed to the next stage**.

  Here are some of the basic stages in the Aggregation Framework:

  - $match: **This stage is used to filter the documents in the collection based on certain conditions.** For example, you can use $match to find all documents with a specific value for a field.

  - $group: This stage is **used to group the documents in the collection based on a specific field or set of fields**. You can use $group to calculate aggregate values like sums, averages, or counts for each group.
    db.orders.aggregate([
       {
          $group: {
             _id: { product: "$product", customer: "$customer", date: "$date" },
             maxPrice: { $max: "$price" }
          }
       }
    ])


  - $project: This stage is **used to specify which fields should be included in the result set** and how they should be formatted. You can use $project to rename fields, compute new fields, or remove fields from the result set.

  - $sort: This stage **is used to sort the documents in the collection based on one or more fields**. You can use $sort to sort documents in ascending or descending order.

  - $limit: This stage **is used to limit the number of documents returned in the result set**.

  - $skip: This stage **is used to skip a certain number of documents in the collection before returning the result set**.

- indexes

  - Indexes are used in MongoDB (and other databases) **to improve the performance of queries on a collection**. When a query is executed that involves one or more indexed fields, MongoDB can use the index to quickly locate the documents that match the query criteria.

  - **Without indexes, MongoDB would have to scan every document in the collection to find the matching documents**, which can be slow and resource-intensive, especially on large collections.

  - Indexes improve query performance by providing a way to quickly locate documents that match a query criteria. By reducing the number of documents that MongoDB has to scan, indexes can significantly speed up query execution time.

  - In short, indexes are used in MongoDB to improve the performance of queries on collections by reducing the number of documents that have to be scanned to find the matching documents.

- what are indexes, how to implement unique field using indexes with example
  Indexes in MongoDB are data structures that improve the performance of queries on a collection. An index consists of an ordered list of fields and associated values, and is stored separately from the collection data.

  **When a query is executed that involves the indexed fields, MongoDB can use the index to quickly locate the documents that match the query criteria**. This can significantly improve query performance, especially on large collections.

  **In MongoDB, you can create indexes on one or more fields using the createIndex() method**. For example, to create an index on the name field of a collection called users, you can run the following command:
  db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 })

  **To implement a unique field using indexes, you can create a unique index on that field.** For example, to create a unique index on the username field of a collection called users, you can run the following command:
  **db.users.createIndex({ username: 1 }, { unique: true })**

  This creates a unique index on the username field, which ensures that no two documents in the collection can have the same value for the username field. If you attempt to insert a document with a duplicate username value, MongoDB will throw an error.

  You can also create a sparse unique index, which allows multiple documents to have a null value for the indexed field. For example, to create a sparse unique index on the email field of the users collection, you can run the following command:
  db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 }, { unique: true, sparse: true })

- What types of schema design / data modeling design pattern in mongodb and how you decide which model should be used

  - In MongoDB, there are several **data modeling design patterns** that can be used to represent different types of relationships between data. Some of the commonly used design patterns include:

  - Embedded Data Model: In this pattern, **data is stored in a single document and related data is nested within the parent document.** This is suitable for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships where the related data is not accessed independently from the parent document.
    -  For example, a document could contain information about a user, including their name, email address, and a list of their favorite books. Here's an example:
      {
        "_id": ObjectId("60937cfc3cde3d3dcf8c29b4"),
        "name": "John Smith",
        "email": "john@example.com",
        "favorites": [
          {"title": "To Kill a Mockingbird", "author": "Harper Lee"},
          {"title": "The Great Gatsby", "author": "F. Scott Fitzgerald"}
        ]
      }


  - Normalized Data Model / Referenced data model: In this pattern, **related data is stored in separate collections and referenced by their identifiers in the parent document.** This is suitable for many-to-many relationships and one-to-many relationships where the related data is frequently accessed independently from the parent document. 
    - For example, a document could contain information about a blog post, including its title, author ID, and category ID. Here's an example:
        {
          "_id": ObjectId("6093836c3cde3d3dcf8c29b5"),
          "title": "10 Tips for Better Sleep",
          "author": ObjectId("60937cfc3cde3d3dcf8c29b4"),
          "category": ObjectId("609382f53cde3d3dcf8c29b3")
        }

  - Hybrid Data Model: In this pattern, a combination of embedded, normalized, and denormalized data modeling patterns are used to optimize performance and ensure data consistency.

  - Denormalized Data Model: In this pattern, related data is duplicated in multiple documents to avoid expensive joins and improve query performance. This is suitable for read-heavy applications where query performance is a critical requirement and data consistency is less important.

  When deciding which data modeling design pattern to use, it is important to consider the application's data access patterns, performance requirements, and data consistency requirements.

  If the application frequently accesses related data together and the relationships are one-to-one or one-to-many, an embedded data model may be suitable. If the relationships are many-to-many or the related data is frequently accessed independently, a normalized data model may be more appropriate. If performance is a critical requirement and data consistency can be managed through other means, a denormalized data model may be the best choice.

  A hybrid data modeling approach can be used to optimize performance while ensuring data consistency, but it requires careful consideration of the trade-offs between data duplication, query complexity, and maintenance complexity.

  In summary, the choice of data modeling design pattern in MongoDB depends on the application's data access patterns, performance requirements, and data consistency requirements. It is important to carefully evaluate the trade-offs between the different design patterns and choose the one that best meets the application's requirements.

- Joins in mongoDB

  - MongoDB does not support traditional SQL-style joins because it is a document-oriented database that stores data in a denormalized format. Instead, MongoDB provides several techniques for performing operations that are similar to joins in relational databases.
  - Here are some of the techniques for joining data in MongoDB:
  - Embedded documents: In MongoDB, you can embed related data within a document. For example, if you have a users collection and a posts collection, you can embed all of a user's posts within the user document. This allows you to fetch a user's posts with a single query to the users collection.
  - $lookup operator: The $lookup operator is used to perform a left outer join between two collections in MongoDB. It allows you to reference data from one collection in another collection. For example, if you have a users collection and a posts collection, you can use the $lookup operator to fetch all posts for a user.
  - Denormalization: In MongoDB, denormalization involves duplicating data across documents to avoid joining. For example, if you have a users collection and a posts collection, you can denormalize the data by including the user's name and other relevant data in the post document.
  - It is important to note that denormalization can lead to data redundancy and increase storage requirements, so it should be used judiciously.
  - When deciding which technique to use, it is important to consider the specific use case, data access patterns, and query performance requirements. Some factors to consider include:
    - Data size and complexity: Embedded documents work best for simpler, smaller datasets, while $lookup and denormalization are better for more complex or larger datasets.
    - Query performance requirements: Embedded documents and denormalization can be faster for queries that require data from multiple collections, while $lookup can be faster for queries that require only data from a single collection.
    - Data consistency requirements: Embedded documents and denormalization can lead to data redundancy and inconsistencies, while $lookup ensures data consistency between collections.

- Joins in mongoDB with examples
  MongoDB does not have traditional SQL-style joins, but it provides several techniques for performing operations that are similar to joins in relational databases. Here are some examples:

  - Embedded documents:
    Suppose you have two collections: users and orders. You can embed all of a user's orders within the user document, like this:
      {
      "_id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "orders": [
        {
        "order_id": 1,
        "product": "iPhone",
        "quantity": 2
        },
        {
        "order_id": 2,
        "product": "iPad",
        "quantity": 1
        }
      ]
      }
    This allows you to fetch a user's orders with a single query to the users collection, like this:

    db.users.find({"name": "John Doe"})

  - $lookup operator:
    Suppose you have two collections: users and orders. You can use the $lookup operator to fetch all orders for a user, like this:

    db.users.aggregate([
    {
      $lookup:
      {
        from: "orders",
        localField: "_id",
        foreignField: "user_id",
        as: "orders"
      }
    }])
    This will perform a left outer join between the users and orders collections, based on the user_id field in the orders collection and the _id field in the users collection. The resulting document will include all fields from the users collection, plus a new field orders that contains an array of all orders associated with the user.

  - Denormalization:
    Suppose you have two collections: users and orders. You can denormalize the data by including the user's name and other relevant data in the order document, like this:

    {
    "_id": 1,
    "user_id": 1,
    "user_name": "John Doe",
    "product": "iPhone",
    "quantity": 2
    }
    This allows you to fetch all orders for a user with a single query to the orders collection, like this:

    db.orders.find({"user_id": 1})
    It is important to note that denormalization can lead to data redundancy and increase storage requirements, so it should be used judiciously.

- what is aggregation in mongoDB and write lookup aggregation pipeline
  Aggregation in MongoDB is the **process of performing data processing operations on a collection of documents**. Aggregation pipeline is a framework for aggregating data in MongoDB. It allows you to process data using a set of stages, where each stage transforms the data as it passes through the pipeline.

  The $lookup operator is used to perform a left outer join between two collections in MongoDB. It allows you to reference data from one collection in another collection. Here is an example of how to use the $lookup operator in an aggregation pipeline:

  Suppose you have two collections: orders and products. The orders collection contains documents representing orders, with a product_id field referencing the products collection:
    {
      "_id": 1,
      "product_id": 1,
      "quantity": 2
    },
    {
      "_id": 2,
      "product_id": 2,
      "quantity": 1
    }

  The products collection contains documents representing products, with a product_id field matching the product_id field in the orders collection:
  {
    "_id": 1,
    "name": "iPhone",
    "price": 999
  },
  {
    "_id": 2,
    "name": "iPad",
    "price": 799
  }

  You can use the $lookup operator to fetch the product information for each order, like this:
  db.orders.aggregate([
    {
      $lookup:
      {
        from: "products",
        localField: "product_id",
        foreignField: "_id",
        as: "product"
      }
  }])

  This will perform a left outer join between the orders and products collections, based on the product_id field in the orders collection and the _id field in the products collection. The resulting documents will include all fields from the orders collection, plus a new field product that contains an array of all matching products associated with each order:
  {
  "_id": 1,
  "product_id": 1,
  "quantity": 2,
  "product": [
  {
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "iPhone",
  "price": 999
  }
  ]
  },
  {
  "_id": 2,
  "product_id": 2,
  "quantity": 1,
  "product": [
  {
  "_id": 2,
  "name": "iPad",
  "price": 799
  }
  ]
  }
  Note that the as option in the $lookup operator is used to specify the name of the new field that will contain the joined data.

- Write is query to update any particular array element of embedded document
  To update a particular array element of an embedded document in MongoDB, you can use the $ positional operator in combination with the $set operator. Here's an example:

  Suppose you have a collection called users, where each document represents a user with an array of addresses, where each address is an embedded document with street, city, and state fields:
  {
    "_id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "addresses": [
        {
        " street": "123 Main St",
          "city": "Anytown",
          "state": "CA"
        },
        {
         "street": "456 Elm St",
          "city": "Anytown",
          "state": "CA"
        }
      ]
  }

  To update the state field of the second address, you can use the following update query:
  db.users.updateOne(
  { "_id": 1, "addresses.street": "456 Elm St" },
  { "$set": {"addresses.$.state": "NY" } }
  )

  Here, we use the updateOne method to update the document that matches the filter { "_id": 1, "addresses.street": "456 Elm St" }. The $ positional operator is used in the $set operator to specify which array element to update - in this case, the one that matched the filter. Finally, we set the new value of the state field to "NY".

  After running the above query, the document will be updated as follows:
  {
  "_id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "addresses": [
  {
  "street": "123 Main St",
  "city": "Anytown",
  "state": "CA"
  },
  {
  "street": "456 Elm St",
  "city": "Anytown",
  "state": "NY"
  }
  ]
  }

- How to bulk insert & bulk update both in the single mongoDB query
  It is not possible to perform bulk insert and bulk update in a single MongoDB query. However, you can achieve this functionality by using the bulkWrite method, which allows you to perform multiple write operations in a single request to the server.

  Here's an example that demonstrates how to use bulkWrite to perform both bulk insert and bulk update operations:
  const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

  // Connection URL
  const url = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';

  // Database Name
  const dbName = 'mydb';

  // Create a new MongoClient
  const client = new MongoClient(url);

  // Use connect method to connect to the server
  client.connect(function(err) {
  if (err) throw err;

      const db = client.db(dbName);

      const operations = [
        { insertOne: { document: { name: 'John Doe', age: 30 } } },
        { insertOne: { document: { name: 'Jane Smith', age: 25 } } },
        { updateOne: { filter: { name: 'John Doe' }, update: { $set: { age: 31 } } } },
        { updateOne: { filter: { name: 'Jane Smith' }, update: { $set: { age: 26 } } } }
      ];

      db.collection('users').bulkWrite(operations, function(err, result) {
        if (err) throw err;

        console.log(result);

        // Close the client connection
        client.close();
      });

  });

  In the example above, we first create an array of write operations that contains two insertOne operations to insert new documents into the users collection, and two updateOne operations to update the age of existing documents in the collection. We then pass this array to the bulkWrite method of the collection, which executes the operations in bulk.

  Note that the bulkWrite method can also accept other write operation types, such as updateMany, deleteOne, and deleteMany.

- wildcard index
  A wildcard index in MongoDB is a type of index that is used to index all fields in a document. It is also known as a "text index" or a "catch-all index".

  A wildcard index is useful when you need to search for documents based on any field in the document, without knowing in advance which fields to search. It can also be used to perform text searches on multiple fields at once.

  Here's an example of how to create a wildcard index on a collection:
  db.myCollection.createIndex({ "$\*\*": "text" })

  In this example, the createIndex method is called on the myCollection collection, with the { "$\*\*": "text" } argument. This tells MongoDB to create a text index on all fields in the collection.

  Once the wildcard index is created, you can perform text searches on any field in the collection by using the $text operator. Here's an example of a text search on a wildcard index:
  db.myCollection.find({ $text: { $search: "example" } })

  In this example, the find method is called on the myCollection collection, with a query that includes the $text operator. The $search operator specifies the text to search for. This will match any document that contains the word "example" in any field of the document.

  Note that while wildcard indexes can be useful in certain scenarios, they can also be resource-intensive and may not be necessary for all use cases. Additionally, they may not provide as much control over the indexing and search process as creating indexes on specific fields. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider your indexing strategy based on your specific use case and performance requirements.

- sharding
  Sharding is a technique used in MongoDB to horizontally partition data across multiple servers, or shards, in a cluster. This enables MongoDB to scale out horizontally to handle large amounts of data and high read/write workloads.

  In a sharded cluster, each shard contains a subset of the total data. MongoDB uses a sharding key to determine which shard a document belongs to. The sharding key is a field or set of fields that are used to partition the data across the shards.

  When a client issues a query to a sharded cluster, the mongos router component routes the query to the appropriate shards based on the sharding key. The mongos component acts as a proxy between the client and the shards, and handles the distribution of queries and aggregation operations across the shards.

  To set up sharding in MongoDB, you typically follow these high-level steps:

  - Deploy a sharded cluster with one or more shards, each consisting of one or more replica sets.
  - Choose a sharding key based on your data and access patterns.
  - Create indexes on the sharding key fields to ensure efficient query routing.
  - Enable sharding for the database and collection that you want to shard.
  - Use the sh.shardCollection() command to specify the sharding key for the collection.

  Here's an example of how to enable sharding for a collection in MongoDB:
  use myDatabase
  sh.enableSharding("myDatabase")
  db.myCollection.createIndex({ "shardingKeyField": 1 })
  sh.shardCollection("myDatabase.myCollection", { "shardingKeyField": 1 })

  In this example, we first enable sharding for the myDatabase database using the sh.enableSharding() command. We then create an index on the shardingKeyField field using the createIndex() method, and finally enable sharding for the myCollection collection using the sh.shardCollection() command. The sh.shardCollection() command specifies the sharding key as { "shardingKeyField": 1 }, which tells MongoDB to shard the collection based on the values of the shardingKeyField field.

  Note that while sharding can provide significant scalability benefits for large-scale MongoDB deployments, it also introduces additional complexity and overhead, and requires careful planning and management to ensure optimal performance.

- replica set
  A replica set in MongoDB is a **group of MongoDB servers that work together to provide high availability and data redundancy**. A replica set consists of **one primary node and one or more secondary nodes, which are all running the same dataset.** **The primary node is responsible for handling all write operations, while the secondary nodes replicate data from the primary node and can handle read operations.**

  If the primary node fails, the replica set automatically elects a new primary node from among the remaining nodes in the set. This ensures that the replica set remains available and can continue to accept write operations even in the event of a node failure.

  To set up a replica set in MongoDB, you typically follow these high-level steps:

  - Deploy multiple MongoDB nodes that will be part of the replica set.
  - Configure each node to use the same replica set name.
  - Start each node as a standalone instance, and then initialize the replica set using the rs.initiate() command on one of the nodes.
  - Add additional nodes to the replica set using the rs.add() command.
  - Monitor the replica set to ensure that it is healthy and operating properly.
    Here's an example of how to create a replica set in MongoDB:
    Deploy three MongoDB nodes, each running on a separate server.
    Configure each node to use the same replica set name, such as myReplicaSet.
    Start each node as a standalone instance, and then initialize the replica set on the first node using the following command:

  rs.initiate( {
  _id : "myReplicaSet",
  members: [
  { _id: 0, host: "node1:27017" },
  { _id: 1, host: "node2:27017" },
  { _id: 2, host: "node3:27017" }
  ]
  })
  In this example, we use the rs.initiate() command to initialize the replica set on the first node. The command specifies the replica set name as myReplicaSet, and defines the members of the replica set using the members array. Each member is identified by an _id value and the hostname and port number of the MongoDB node.

  Once the replica set is initialized, you can add additional nodes to the set using the rs.add() command. You can also monitor the replica set using various commands and tools, such as the rs.status() command or the MongoDB Compass graphical user interface.

- index prefix
  **Index prefix is a technique used in MongoDB indexing where only a portion of a field is indexed, instead of the entire field.** In MongoDB, an index prefix is a type of index that **indexes only the first few fields of a compound index.** This can be useful when you have a large index with many fields, but only need to search on a subset of those fields.

  Here's an example of how to create an index prefix in MongoDB:

  Suppose you have a collection called orders that contains documents with the following fields:
    {
      "_id": ObjectId("6112f1a6a33c6fca0df47d2e"),
      "customer_id": "1234",
      "order_date": ISODate("2022-04-28T09:00:00Z"),
      "total_price": 100.00,
      "items": [
        {
          "product_id": "5678",
          "quantity": 2,
          "price": 50.00
        }
      ]
    }
    You want to be able to search for orders based on the customer ID and order date, so you can create a compound index on those two fields:

    db.orders.createIndex({"customer_id": 1, "order_date": 1})
    This index will allow you to perform efficient queries that filter on both the customer_id and order_date fields. However, if you only need to search on the customer_id field, you can create an index prefix that only indexes that field:

    db.orders.createIndex({"customer_id": 1})


- planners
  In MongoDB, query planners are responsible for optimizing the execution of database queries. There are two types of query planners in MongoDB:

  The query optimizer: This planner is responsible for selecting the most efficient query plan for a given query. The optimizer examines the available indexes and statistics on the collection to determine the best query plan. The selected query plan is cached for reuse to avoid the need for re-optimization.

  The execution engine: Once the query plan has been selected, the execution engine is responsible for executing the query. The execution engine is optimized for high performance and parallelism, and is designed to take full advantage of modern multi-core processors.

  The query planner uses a variety of techniques to optimize queries, including index selection, query rewriting, and query analysis. When a query is submitted to MongoDB, the query planner examines the query's fields and compares them to the available indexes to determine which index or combination of indexes can be used to execute the query most efficiently. If no index is available, the query planner may choose to scan the entire collection.

  The query planner also performs query analysis to determine the best execution plan based on the characteristics of the query, such as the size of the result set and the number of joins involved. For example, the query planner may choose to use a merge join instead of a nested loop join if the result set is large.

  In general, the query planner in MongoDB is designed to be flexible and efficient, allowing for fast and scalable execution of complex queries.

- partial index
 **A partial index is a type of index in MongoDB that indexes a subset of documents in a collection, based on a specified filter expression.** Unlike regular indexes, which index all documents in a collection, a partial index only indexes those documents that match the specified filter expression. This can be useful in cases where only a subset of the documents in a collection require indexing, such as when working with large collections or when certain documents are rarely queried.
  Here's an example of how to create a partial index in MongoDB:

  Suppose you have a collection called orders that contains documents with the following fields:
  
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6112f1a6a33c6fca0df47d2e"),
    "customer_id": "1234",
    "order_date": ISODate("2022-04-28T09:00:00Z"),
    "status": "fulfilled",
    "total_price": 100.00,
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": "5678",
        "quantity": 2,
        "price": 50.00
      }
    ]
  }
  You want to be able to search for orders based on the customer_id field, but you only want to index orders that are in the fulfilled status. You can create a partial index to achieve this:

  db.orders.createIndex(
    {"customer_id": 1},
    {"partialFilterExpression": {"status": "fulfilled"}}
  )

  Partial indexes can be created using the db.collection.createIndex() method, with the partialFilterExpression option specified to define the filter expression. For example, the following command creates a partial index on a users collection, indexing only documents where the status field is equal to "active":
  db.users.createIndex({email: 1}, {partialFilterExpression: {status: "active"}})

  In this example, the partial index is created on the email field, but only for documents where the status field is equal to "active". This means that only those documents that match the filter expression will be included in the index, reducing the index size and improving query performance.

  Partial indexes can be especially useful in cases where storage space is limited, as they can reduce the size of the index by excluding documents that are not relevant to the query. They can also improve query performance by reducing the number of documents that need to be scanned during the query. However, it's important to carefully choose the filter expression when creating a partial index to ensure that it matches the queries that will be run against the collection.

- mongodb scaling
  MongoDB supports several scaling options to handle the increasing load on the database:

  Vertical scaling: This involves increasing the capacity of a single server by adding more resources, such as CPU, RAM, and storage. This is the simplest and most cost-effective method of scaling, but there is a limit to how much a single server can scale.

  Horizontal scaling: This involves adding more servers to distribute the load across multiple machines. MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, which involves splitting the data across multiple servers based on a sharding key. This can improve performance and scalability, but requires more complex configuration and management.

  Replica sets: MongoDB supports replica sets, which are a group of MongoDB servers that maintain the same data set. Replica sets provide high availability and automatic failover in the event of a server failure.

  Cloud-based solutions: Cloud-based solutions such as MongoDB Atlas offer managed services for MongoDB, including automatic scaling and high availability.

  When scaling MongoDB, it's important to consider the needs of the application and choose the appropriate scaling option based on performance, availability, and cost. It's also important to monitor the performance of the database and adjust the scaling as needed to ensure optimal performance.

- Given 2 collections users and orders find the count of orders that each user makes. Also exclude those records which do not have an order associated with them

  To find the count of orders that each user makes and exclude those records which do not have an order associated with them, we can use the $lookup aggregation stage in MongoDB to perform a left outer join between the users and orders collections, followed by a $match stage to filter out those users who do not have an order associated with them, and a $group stage to group the orders by user and count the number of orders per user.

  Here's an example query:
  db.users.aggregate([
  {
  $lookup: {
          from: "orders",
          localField: "_id",
          foreignField: "user_id",
          as: "orders"
        }
      },
      {
        $match: {
          orders: { $ne: [] }
        }
      },
      {
        $group: {
          _id: "$_id",
  name: { $first: "$name" },
  email: { $first: "$email" },
  order_count: { $sum: { $size: "$orders" } }
  }
  }
  ])

  In this query, we first use the $lookup stage to join the users collection with the orders collection, using the _id field in the users collection and the user_id field in the orders collection. This creates a new field orders in each user document, which contains an array of all orders associated with that user.

  Next, we use the $match stage to filter out those users whose orders field is an empty array, indicating that they have no orders associated with them.

  Finally, we use the $group stage to group the orders by user and count the number of orders per user. We also use the $first operator to include the user's name and email fields in the output. The $sum operator with $size is used to count the number of orders per user.

  This query will return a list of users with the count of orders each user has, excluding those users who do not have any orders associated with them.

- given USERS and ORDERS(it has user_id assosiated as reference for USERS collection) collection,

1. list down all users along with theirs orders
2. further filter out the users with no orders
   To list down all users along with their orders, and then filter out users with no orders, we can use the $lookup aggregation pipeline stage in MongoDB to perform a left outer join between the USERS and ORDERS collections based on the user_id field in the ORDERS collection and the _id field in the USERS collection. Here are the queries to accomplish this:

   To list down all users along with their orders:
   db.USERS.aggregate([
   {
   $lookup: {
   from: "ORDERS",
   localField: "_id",
   foreignField: "user_id",
   as: "orders"
   }
   }
   ])

   In this query, we use the $lookup stage to join the USERS and ORDERS collections based on the user_id field in the ORDERS collection and the _id field in the USERS collection. This creates a new field called orders in each document in the USERS collection, which contains an array of all the orders associated with that user.

   To filter out users with no orders:
   db.USERS.aggregate([
   {
   $lookup: {
   from: "ORDERS",
   localField: "_id",
   foreignField: "user_id",
   as: "orders"
   }
   },
   {
   $match: {
   orders: {
   $not: { $size: 0 }
   }
   }
   }
   ])

   In this query, we use the $lookup stage to join the USERS and ORDERS collections based on the user_id field in the ORDERS collection and the _id field in the USERS collection. This creates a new field called orders in each document in the USERS collection, which contains an array of all the orders associated with that user.

   Then we use the $match stage to filter out the documents where the orders array has a size of 0, which means that the user has no orders associated with them.

   This query will return a list of all users along with their orders, and then filter out users with no orders.


- additional
  In MongoDB, the three main types of relationships are also present, but they are implemented differently because MongoDB is a document-oriented database. Here are some examples of how these relationships can be represented in MongoDB:

  One-to-One (1:1) Relationship:
  Example: A database for a blog might have a collection for authors and a collection for author details. Each author has a unique ID, and that ID is linked to a single document in the author details collection that contains additional information about the author, such as their bio, photo, and social media links.

  Authors collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093ab41a1009b4829e76f02"),
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@example.com"
  }

  Author_Details collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093ab46a1009b4829e76f03"),
    "author_id": ObjectId("6093ab41a1009b4829e76f02"),
    "bio": "John Smith is a freelance writer based in New York City.",
    "photo": "https://example.com/john-smith.jpg",
    "social_media": [
      {
        "name": "Twitter",
        "link": "https://twitter.com/johnsmith"
      },
      {
        "name": "LinkedIn",
        "link": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnsmith/"
      }
    ]
  }
  One-to-Many (1:N) Relationship:
  Example: A database for a music streaming service might have a collection for users and a collection for playlists. Each user can have multiple playlists, but each playlist is linked to a single user.

  Users collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093b2fca1009b4829e76f05"),
    "username": "jsmith",
    "email": "jsmith@example.com"
  }

  Playlists collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093b38aa1009b4829e76f06"),
    "name": "Driving Playlist",
    "user_id": ObjectId("6093b2fca1009b4829e76f05"),
    "songs": [
      {
        "title": "Sweet Child O' Mine",
        "artist": "Guns N' Roses"
      },
      {
        "title": "Hotel California",
        "artist": "Eagles"
      }
    ]
  }
  Many-to-Many (N:M) Relationship:
  Example: A database for an e-commerce site might have a collection for products and a collection for orders. Each product can be ordered multiple times, and each order can contain multiple products.

  css
  Copy code
  Products collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093b5e9a1009b4829e76f08"),
    "name": "iPhone 12",
    "price": 799
  }

  Orders collection:
  {
    "_id": ObjectId("6093b65ca1009b4829e76f09"),
    "order_number": 1234,
    "products": [
      {
        "product_id": ObjectId("6093b5e9a1009b4829e76f08"),
        "quantity": 2
      },
      {
        "product_id": ObjectId("6093b6b1a1009b4829e76f0a"),
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
  In MongoDB, these relationships can be represented using embedded documents or references, depending on the specific use case and requirements.
